__Notes about the format of the file: ______________________________

You may insert random comments like these, but such comments
may not include the tokens 'CAMERA', 'PLANE', 'TRIANGLE', 'SPHERE', 
or 'LIGHT'.  These are reserved tags for describing the scene.  
After such tags are specified, the order and number of arguments 
directly proceeding them are not optional.  

The subtags used to give meaning to the following sets of numbers
are not actually used by the parser.  The parser assumes the subtags
appear in the exact order given below.  The only purpose of the
subtags is to aid human readability.

In between blocks, you may again write comments.
